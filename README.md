# AWS-HostedFTP-Web-App
Java web app 

This is a web app that I was tasked with creating for an interview but decided to continue improving it as a test to myself. 

As you can see from the source code, I used Java as the main language while utilizing HTML, CSS, and a little bit of Javascript for some features on the HTML page.

I really wanted to have my own website published so i want to improve on this and test my skills as a programmer and developer.

I utilize TomCat server with Nginx to reverse proxy and handle the requests while using services from AWS to host the webapp on my domain.

I will update this as I go and the link to the actual website is https://personaljava.rambpersonal.click
